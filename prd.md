## Product Requirements Document (PRD): Text Input Showcase Mobile App

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the product requirements for a lightweight application designed to showcase common text input use cases found in top-ranked applications. The "Text Input Showcase" app will be built using Flutter and will demonstrate various text input scenarios without storing any user data.  **Crucially, this application will not only serve as a demonstration of these common text input scenarios but also as a tool to test and verify the fidelity of Flutter's text input implementation compared to default platform text input behaviors on iOS, Android, and the Web.**  This tri-purpose will allow us to both showcase best practices in text input design, ensure that Flutter effectively replicates the native text input experience users expect on their devices and browsers, and assess the quality and accuracy of Flutter's text input rendering across all targeted platforms. The primary goal is to provide users with an interactive experience to explore different text input functionalities on their mobile devices and web browsers, highlighting platform-specific features on iOS and Android, and browser-standard behaviors on the Web, while simultaneously evaluating Flutter's text input fidelity.  **Furthermore, this application will explicitly demonstrate text input implementations for each scenario using both Cupertino and Material Design widgets within Flutter, showcasing and allowing direct comparison of text input behavior across both widget styles.**

**2. Goals**

*   Demonstrate a variety of common text input scenarios found in popular applications.
*   **Showcase how Flutter is able to match and deliver platform-specific text input features from iOS and Android, and standard text input behaviors on the Web, using both Cupertino and Material widgets for every scenario.**
*   Provide a user-friendly and interactive experience for exploring text input functionalities across mobile and web platforms, and comparing widget styles.
*   Create a lightweight, self-contained application that does not store any user data.
*   Serve as a practical demonstration tool for developers, designers, and anyone interested in mobile and web text input best practices and Flutter widget styling.
*   Test and verify the fidelity of Flutter's text input implementation in replicating native platform text input behaviors and features across iOS, Android, and Web, **including core functionalities like Copy and Paste, and widget-specific behaviors for both Cupertino and Material components across all scenarios.**

**3. Target Audience**

*   **Flutter Framework Engineers (Text Input Focus):**  Engineers responsible for developing, maintaining, and improving Flutter's text input implementations across platforms (iOS, Android, Web), with a particular interest in Cupertino and Material widget fidelity and comparative behavior.
*   **Flutter Product Managers (Platform Fidelity & User Experience):** Product managers responsible for the overall quality and user experience of Flutter, with a specific interest in ensuring platform fidelity for core features like text input across mobile and web, and across widget styles, and understanding the nuances of Material vs. Cupertino implementations.

    *   **Explicitly verify standard Android Copy and Paste behavior using long-press context menus and system clipboard for both Material and Cupertino widget implementations.**

*   **Web:**
    *   Demonstrate standard browser text input behaviors:
        *   Basic text input in `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements.
        *   Browser **Autofill** for relevant fields (e.g., address, credit card) if configured in the browser.
        *   Copy and Paste functionality (standard browser behavior).
        *   Right-click context menu (standard browser behavior).
        *   Form input types and attributes (e.g., `type="email"`, `type="password"`, `inputmode`, `pattern`, `placeholder`).
        *   Observe keyboard behavior on mobile browsers when running the web app.
    *   Focus on verifying that Flutter Web's text input fields behave consistently with standard web browser text input.
    *   **Explicitly verify standard Web Copy and Paste behavior using right-click context menus and keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+C/V). Ensure compatibility across major browsers for both Material and Cupertino widget implementations.**

**7. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)**

*   **Clean and Intuitive Design:** The UI should be simple and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly access and understand each text input scenario across mobile and web, and easily switch between widget styles.
*   **Clear Labeling:** Each screen and input field should be clearly labeled to indicate the use case and widget style (Cupertino/Material) currently being displayed for easy understanding and comparison.
*   **Platform/Browser-Native Look and Feel & Widget Style Demonstration:**  While built in Flutter, the UI should strive to feel reasonably platform-native for both iOS (using Cupertino widgets where appropriate) and Android (using Material widgets), and browser-standard for the Web.  **The app will intentionally showcase both Cupertino and Material widgets for *every* scenario, using a clear UI mechanism (e.g., toggle or tabs at the top of each scenario screen) to allow users to switch between and directly compare the Material and Cupertino implementations of the same text input scenario.** This visual and interactive comparison is a core UX element.
*   **No Navigation Complexity:** Simple screen transitions to navigate between scenarios. A basic list or tab-based navigation could suffice, adaptable to both mobile and web layouts.

**8. Technology Stack**

*   **Flutter:** For cross-platform application development (iOS, Android, and Web).

**9. Out of Scope**

*   Backend server or database integration.
*   User authentication or account management within the app.
*   Complex UI animations or transitions beyond basic screen navigation.
*   Data persistence – no user data will be saved.
*   In-app suggestions or auto-complete functionality beyond what is provided by the native platform/browser text input systems.
*   Custom keyboard implementations.
*   Detailed accessibility feature implementation (basic accessibility considerations should be followed, but in-depth accessibility testing and optimization are out of scope for this lightweight demo).
